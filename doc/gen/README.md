# Important sizes

Clearance: 0.2 mm (8 mils)

Track width: N/A mm (N/A mils)

- By design rules: 0.2 mm (8 mils)

Drill: 1.1 mm (43 mils)

- Vias: N/A mm (N/A mils) [Design: 0.4 mm (16 mils)]
- Pads: 1.1 mm (43 mils)
- The above values are real drill sizes, they add 0.1 mm (4 mils) to plated holes (PTH)

- By design rules: 0.4/0.3 mm (16/12 mils)
- Micro via: yes [0.2/0.1 mm (8/4 mils)]
- Buried/blind via: yes
- Total: 0 (thru: 0 buried/blind: 0 micro: 0)

Outer Annular Ring: 0.3 mm (12 mils)

- By design rules: 0.3 mm (12 mils)

Eurocircuits class: 4A

Solder paste stats:

Using a paste with 87.75 % alloy, that has an specific gravity for the alloy of 7.4 g/cm³
and 1.0 g/cm³ for the flux. This paste has an specific gravity of  4.15 g/cm³.

The stencil thickness is  0.12 mm.

| Side   | Pads with paste | Area [mm²] | Paste [g] |
|--------|-----------------|------------|-----------|
| Total  |              52 |      53.46 |      0.27 |

Note: this is just an approximation to the theoretical value. Margins of the solder mask and waste aren't computed.
